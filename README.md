# Cisc275Project
Group Project for CISC 275

This branch is soley for editing the model

Key: D = done, I = in progress

Goals:

    rename fishCharacter to mainCharacter -D
    
    toString() -D
    
    (At this point I need to tackle the controller to allow for a 
        toggle to use or do not use the view)
    Will also fix any errors along the way
    
    Toggle for fish speed
    
    proper movement
        main game
            fish will move up and down on screen only
            map will move left to right on screen only
        minigame
            scuba diver will be the only thing moving
    
    Allow controller to access vector components
        This will allow for easy determination of vector
            from mouse to fish
            to determine the fish direction
    proper collision handling
    
    sorting
   
    Toggle for tick rate
    Synchronize all ticks
    
    benefits of eating foo
    
    game over methods
        winning
        losing
    
    minigame
        literally everything
    
    random perturbations to trash movement
