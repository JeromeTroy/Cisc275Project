# Cisc275Project
Group Project for CISC 275

This branch is soley for editing the model

Key: D = done, I = in progress

Goals:

    rename fishCharacter to mainCharacter -D
    
    toString() -D
    
    (At this point I need to tackle the controller to allow for a 
        toggle to use or do not use the view)
    Will also fix any errors along the way
    
    -D  :-)
    
    Toggle for fish speed -D
    
    Simplify all code to reduce class instances -I
    
    proper movement in main game 
            fish will move up and down on screen only
            map will move left to right on screen only
        
    Allow controller to access vector components
        This will allow for easy determination of vector
            from mouse to fish
            to determine the fish direction
    proper collision handling
    
    sorting
   
    Toggle for tick rate
    Synchronize all ticks
